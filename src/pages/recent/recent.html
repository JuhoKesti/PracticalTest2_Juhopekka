<h1>
  The Burning of Teldrassil
</h1>
  <p>
   As usual the Alliance blames all their faults and losses on us the Horde. Their leaders brazenly trash our reputation with these dishonorable acts.
   We believe that Genn Greymane and Jaina Proudmoore burnt down the World Tree to incite violence between us and the Alliance. 
   They'll have little trouble convincing those mindless Alliance grunts since Garrosh's dishonorable deeds are still on the surface.
   <br>
   <br>
   This is a tactical move from Greymane. Inciting war while we all are still recovering from our losses at the Broken Shore. 
   Attacking Undercity is viable strategy while most of the Horde's regiments are in Kalimdor. Also capturing our Warchief's own stronghold is a strong political move to undermine her leading potential.
   <br>
   <br>
   We will NOT stand idly by while our honorable name is dragged down to the dirt.
   We shall give Greymane and Proudmoore the war they want.
