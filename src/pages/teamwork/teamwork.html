    <h2>Teamwork</h2>
    <p> As listed in soft skills I like to think that I'm good teamworker. In school we follow method called LbD, which in general means that we do a lot of project work in teams and develop. 
      <br> On our mobile development course I worked alot with my to good friends. Jere Lämsä and Jenni Hyvärinen. Our teamwork was almost flawless, because of our friendship and because we all are good teamworkers.
