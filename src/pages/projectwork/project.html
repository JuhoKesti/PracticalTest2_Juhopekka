    <h2>Project Work</h2>
    <p> Our schools learning method, LbD or Learning by Developing has affected me much. On my free time i also like to set myself some projects to work on.
      At the moment i'm working on a little game. I would like to continue working on it for next couple of years and when i feel its ready i would like to publish it. 
      Making and publishing a new game has always been a small dream of mine. As im studying i feel like im inching forward to that goal.<br><br>
      At school I've studied mobile app development and I'm planning on continuing studying it so that i may someday publish a small mobile app. All in due time though. 
      On that same mobile app development study unit I have made many projects. Mainly prototypes of this CV application but I have also made a small java project in one of my Java development course. 
      If you would like to have a look at my projects you can go at the GitHub link I'll provide down below.
