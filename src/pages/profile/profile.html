    Welcome to my personal profile. Here i will tell little about myself and my future plans. You can see my profile picture on the left.
  </p>
  <p>I'm 22 year old student from Finland. At the moment I live with my parents at Kirkkonummi, in a small town called Veikkola. In the near future I'm planning on moving out closer to my school which is in Espoo, Lepp√§vaara. My interests are anything IT-related but i'm especially interested in Esports and gaming.
    A small dream of mine has always been to develop a new "killer" app or new type of game. But first i need to study. 
    <br><br>
    I'm second year student in Laurea Univercity of Applied Sciences. In two years im going to become a Bachelor of Information Technology. I'm focusing my studies in app designing and programming languages. 
    I'm already quite fluent in programming with Java and HTML but I'm planning on continuing so i can fullfil my dream.
