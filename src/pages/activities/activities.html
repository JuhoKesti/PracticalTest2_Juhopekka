    <h2>Activities and hobbies</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy being with animals. This also trasfered into my love for outing, mostly taking walks and going to jog in the woods.
       I try to keep up a healty routine as we IT people tend to get in to a bad shape as we don't move much when we work. 
       Now as I'm a student I don't have much time to spend on working out. At the moment i don't have a gymcard but i plan to start going to gym again after the New year. 
       <br><br>
       On my free time I also like to spend time with my real life friends. Mostly we go out parting after rough weeks or we just have a nice easy weekend at home. 
       If I'm not spending time with them I'm mostly hanging with my online friends at my own Teamspeak. Teamspeak is a VOIP server where we can talk to each other as we play games and such. At the moment I'm managing and hosting it with my computer.
